## Separate PHP Logic From Presentation

Instead of nesting PHP in HTML, but: separation of concerns!

We create a file that will be in charge of displaying the data generated by the PHP. We can build a _view_ and call it: `index.view.php`.

We then generate/process the data and display it. For this, we need to call the view file in the `index.php` file:

`require 'index.view.php';
